# 3D_Viewer 1.0
## It's my implemetation of a program to view 3D wireframe models (3D Viewer) in the C and C++ programming languages (Qt). The models themselves must be loaded from .obj files for watching on the screen with the ability to rotate, scale and translate.

The 3DViewer 1.0 is our school project app written in C and C++.
3DViewer is a fast graphic application that allows users of 
all knowledge levels to quickly load files of OBJ filetype and
view 3D wireframe models.
OS - Windows, Linux

This 3D viewing app is fully compatible with Windows 10/Linux and
offers next features inside of its lightweight
package:
- There can be only one model on the screen at a time.
- The maximum size of a model is 1,000,000 vertexes. 
- The app can  translate the model by a given distance in relation to \item the X, Y, Z axes. 
- The program provides the ability to rotate the model by a given angle relative to its X, Y, Z axes and scale the model by a given value.
- The program can be built with Makefile which contains standard set of targets for GNU-programs:
all, install, uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, tests, gcov.



The graphical user interface contains:

- A button to select the model file and a field to output its name.
- A visualisation area for the wireframe model.
- Buttons and input fields for translating the model.
- Buttons and input fields for rotating the model.
- Buttons and input fields for scaling the model.
- A button for customizing the type of projection (parallel and central).
- Buttons for setting up the type (solid, dashed), colour and thickness of the edges, colour of background, display method (none, circle, square), color and size of the vertices.
- A button for saving and uploading settings between program restarts.
- Information about the uploaded model - file name, number of vertices and edges.
- A button for saving the captured (rendered) images as bmp, jpeg and pdf files.
- A button for recording small screencasts of the current custom affine transformation 
of the loaded object into gif-animation (640x480, 10fps, 5s).

3D Viewer is 100\% free for every user and can be used without any restrictions on both your home and work PCs.
